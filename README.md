# QA Assets

Elements related-blobs used for quality assurance. This is more-or-less a copy
of the [Bitcoin Core qa-assets repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets)
but with data appropriate for Elements. It is an entirely separate repo, not a
fork, so any changes upstream need to be manually ported (assuming they make
any sense for Elements).
